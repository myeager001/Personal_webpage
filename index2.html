		<div class='response' id="History">
			<p>I am originally from San Antonio, TX.  I grew up in the city and went to college at UTSA where I studied Finance. I moved to Denver in 2008 and have lived here since.  I have worked in several fields including finance, engineering service, and restaurant management.  I look forward to the next step in my career working in the technology industry.</p>

		<div class='response' id='Family'>
			<p>I am the youngest of four kids.  I have two older brothers and one older sister.  Currently everyone in my family lives around the US.  My oldest brother and mother both live in San Antonio, while my other brother lives in Rockaway, NJ and my sister lives in Cincinnati,Ohio.  I am married and have two kids. Logan is my daughter and she is 4 and Wolfgang is my son and he is just over a year old.  I think the best part of having kids is that they become downloads of your crazy thoughts and ideas.  I find my daughter saying the same things I would say and acting with the same mannerisms.  While extremely challenging, it is also incredibly rewarding and I think the ultimate insurance policy to death because at least I know they will carry on my views.<P>

		<div class='response' id='Interests'>
			<p>When I do get free time I love to play games.  I will play anything that requires strategy or practice to be good.  I love science, particularly physics, and love to read about how new technology is driving current therory.  I love to cook and explore flavors, although I'm not one for following recipes.  My favorite things to cook are soups and rich braised meats because slow cooking makes everything better.  Finally, the old woman in me loves to garden becauses it is very therapeutic seeing the literal fruits of your labor.  I grow hops, tomatoes, beets, corn, herbs, tomatillos, eggplant, brocolli, and many lettuces.</p>
