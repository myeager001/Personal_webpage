			<h3>Where I'm Going</h3>
			<p>I have had the opportunity to work in several fields in my life which has allowed me to understand what I am looking for in a great career.  The reason that this field appeals to me is the balance of creativity and structure, the idea that it requires constant refinement, and knowing that the future relies on technology.</p>
			<h3>Career Goal</h3>
			<p>After finishing this program my hope is to join a small to mid-size company where I can develop my skills in the trade.  I hope to join a company that has a unique idea with growth potential</p>
			<h3>I'm as excited as Jon Stewart at the Emmies!</h3>
